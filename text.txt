In a world of fleeting glances,
Where stars and dreams align,
Whispers dance on midnight breezes,
In the theater of the mind.

Moonlit seas and shadowed forests,
Hold tales not yet told,
Secrets wrapped in golden moments,
Mysteries of old.

Feathers of the phoenix rising,
From embers, red and deep,
Dancing flames, like silent wishes,
Awaken hearts from sleep.

Journey through the veil of time,
On pathways yet unknown,
Seek the magic, embrace the wonder,
Let your spirit freely roam.

For in the canvas of the cosmos,
With every brush and stroke,
Life paints its vibrant story,
In the tales that it evokes.
